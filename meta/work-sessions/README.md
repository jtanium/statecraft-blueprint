# Work Sessions

This directory contains summaries of significant work sessions, particularly those involving AI assistance.

## Purpose

The Statecraft Blueprint is built on complete transparency. That includes documenting not just the ideas themselves, but the **work process** that creates them.

This directory captures:
- Major organizational efforts
- Significant development sessions
- Tool implementation work
- Repository structure changes
- Any substantial AI-assisted work on the project

## Why Document AI Work Sessions?

When using AI to help develop ideas, it's important to document:

1. **What was done** - The actual work accomplished
2. **How it was done** - The process and decisions made
3. **Why** - The reasoning behind organizational choices
4. **What changed** - Before/after state of the repository

This creates a complete audit trail of how the project evolved, including the role of AI assistance.

## Format

Each session summary should include:

- **Date** - When the work was done
- **Summary** - Brief description of what was accomplished
- **Details** - Specifics of what changed, what was created, what was organized
- **Statistics** - Numbers (files moved, documents created, etc.)
- **Reasoning** - Why things were organized this way
- **Next steps** - What should happen next

## Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title.md`

Examples:
- `2025-11-06-repository-setup-and-file-organization.md`
- `2025-11-15-glossary-terms-batch-creation.md`
- `2025-12-01-tool-implementation-sprint.md`

## What Belongs Here vs. Git Commits

**Git commits** capture what changed line-by-line.

**Work session summaries** capture the high-level narrative: the why, the context, the decision-making process.

Both are important. Commits are the detailed log. Session summaries are the readable history.

## For AI Assistants

When you (Claude, or other AI) complete significant work on this project, create a summary here:

1. Document what was done
2. Explain organizational decisions
3. Note any challenges or issues
4. Suggest next steps
5. Include relevant statistics

Make it readable for humans who want to understand how the project evolved.

## For Human Contributors

When you do significant work (especially multi-file reorganization, major features, tool implementation), consider creating a work session summary.

This is particularly valuable when:
- You make major structural changes
- You implement new tooling
- You reorganize large numbers of files
- You want to explain your reasoning for future reference

## Current Sessions

### 2025-11-06: Repository Setup and File Organization

Initial repository structure creation and organization of historical brainstorming files (Nov 3-6, 2025) into the proper directory structure.

See `2025-11-06-repository-setup-and-file-organization.md` for complete details.

## The Meta Point

This directory itself demonstrates the project's philosophy: **document everything**, including the documentation process.

Future historians of ideas (or just future you) will be able to trace not just what ideas emerged, but how the work was done, who (or what AI) did it, and why decisions were made.
