# Roadmap

Where this project is headed and what remains to be done.

## Current Status

**Phase**: Initial Setup & First Concept Development

**Completed**:
- Repository structure established
- Documentation framework in place
- Tooling skeleton created
- Process defined
- First concept (Governance Architecture) in early development

**In Progress**:
- Developing Governance Architecture concept
- Filling out glossary with foundational terms
- Implementing core functionality in tools

## Short-Term Goals (Next 3 Months)

### 1. Complete First Concept

**Goal**: Publish "Governance Architecture" as first complete concept

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Conduct 5-10 exploration conversations
- [ ] Write comprehensive outline
- [ ] Gather 20+ research sources
- [ ] Draft v1.0
- [ ] Iterate to v3.0+
- [ ] Validate and publish

**Success metric**: One published concept with full development history visible

### 2. Build Core Glossary

**Goal**: Define 20-30 foundational terms

**Terms to define**:
- Accountability architecture
- Institutional design
- Governance framework
- Democratic legitimacy
- Public goods
- Collective action
- [Add 15-20 more]

**Success metric**: Comprehensive glossary that other concepts can reference

### 3. Implement Essential Tool Functionality

**Goal**: Make tools actually work, not just skeletons

**Priority tools**:
1. `conversation_converter` - Need to archive conversations
2. `validate_post` - Need for publication workflow
3. `auto_link_terms` - Need for glossary integration
4. `citation_formatter` - Need for research references

**Success metric**: Can use tools in actual workflow without manual intervention

## Medium-Term Goals (3-6 Months)

### 4. Develop Second & Third Concepts

**Potential topics**:
- Electoral system design
- Bureaucratic accountability
- Public participation mechanisms
- Information architecture for democracy
- Institutional incentive structures

**Goal**: Demonstrate that the process works for multiple concepts

### 5. Refine the Process

**Based on experience with first concepts**:
- Update process.md with lessons learned
- Identify tooling gaps
- Improve documentation
- Streamline workflow

### 6. Enable External Contributions

**Goal**: Make it easy for others to contribute

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add contribution examples
- [ ] Create issue templates
- [ ] Write guide for challenging ideas
- [ ] Document research contribution process
- [ ] Set up discussions/forum

## Long-Term Goals (6-12 Months)

### 7. Build Concept Framework

**Goal**: Create reusable analytical frameworks

**Examples**:
- Framework for analyzing institutional incentives
- Framework for evaluating accountability mechanisms
- Framework for assessing information flow
- Framework for measuring democratic legitimacy

These frameworks get applied to multiple specific concepts.

### 8. Develop Interconnected Concept Network

**Goal**: Show how concepts build on each other

**Visualization**:
- Concept dependency graph
- Term usage across concepts
- Research source connections
- Conversation topic evolution

### 9. Publish Compilation

**Goal**: Create a coherent whole from developed concepts

**Format**: Long-form essay or short book combining:
- Published concepts
- Frameworks
- Meta-commentary on the process
- What we learned

**Not**: A finished manifesto, but a snapshot of thinking-in-progress

### 10. Tool Ecosystem Maturity

**Goal**: Tools are robust, tested, well-documented

**Tasks**:
- Full test coverage
- Example inputs/outputs
- Video demonstrations
- Third-party usage
- Tool-specific documentation sites

## Open Questions

Things we don't know yet and need to figure out:

### Process Questions

- How many draft iterations is typical?
- How long should concepts "marinate" before publishing?
- When should concepts be split vs. merged?
- How to handle evolving glossary terms referenced in old drafts?

### Tooling Questions

- Should tools be extracted to separate repo?
- Should there be a web interface for validation?
- Should conversation conversion be more automated?
- Should we build analysis tools for concept relationships?

### Content Questions

- What's the right scope for a single concept?
- How much historical context is needed?
- How to balance theory vs. practical application?
- When to address political feasibility vs. ideal design?

### Community Questions

- How to handle substantive disagreements?
- Should there be a discussion forum?
- How to credit intellectual contributions?
- What's the process for major forks?

## Things We're Explicitly Not Doing

**At least not yet**:

### Not Building

- Web platform (markdown + git is sufficient)
- Social features (use GitHub issues/discussions)
- Publishing platform (focus on content, not distribution)
- Video content (text is the primary medium)

### Not Pursuing

- Academic publication (different goals)
- Mainstream media coverage (not the point)
- Consensus-building (enable branching instead)
- Comprehensive coverage (depth over breadth)

### Not Claiming

- Finished solutions (this is ongoing thinking)
- Novel discoveries (building on existing work)
- Ideological neutrality (have a perspective, document it)
- Universal applicability (context matters)

## Success Metrics

How we'll know if this is working:

### Quality Indicators

- Concepts survive critique and improve from it
- Reasoning is traceable and logical
- Research is thorough and well-cited
- Process is clear and followable

### Engagement Indicators

- Issues raised that improve thinking
- Forks that extend ideas in new directions
- Tools used by others for similar projects
- Research contributions from others

### Personal Indicators

- Understanding deepens through the process
- Writing becomes clearer
- Arguments become stronger
- Willingness to change mind when wrong

**Not measuring**: Page views, social media mentions, mainstream adoption

## How This Roadmap Changes

This roadmap itself will evolve:

- **Monthly reviews**: Check progress, adjust priorities
- **Quarterly updates**: Major revisions based on what's working
- **Document changes**: Git history shows how plans evolved
- **Explain changes**: Commit messages say why priorities shifted

The roadmap is a living document, not a contract.

## Contributing to the Roadmap

Want to influence where this goes?

- **Open issues**: Suggest topics to explore
- **Contribute research**: Add sources for future concepts
- **Challenge priorities**: Explain why something else matters more
- **Share tools**: Build something that extends the workflow

The roadmap responds to what proves valuable.

## Timeline Disclaimer

These timeframes are **aspirational**, not promises.

Real factors affecting pace:
- Full-time work (this is a side project)
- Research depth (some topics require more digging)
- Iteration needs (some concepts need more drafts)
- Life circumstances (things happen)

Quality over speed. If a concept needs more time, it gets more time.

## What Comes After?

Beyond 12 months is too hazy to plan specifically, but potential directions:

- **Scale up**: More concepts, deeper exploration
- **Scale out**: Apply process to adjacent domains
- **Scale meta**: Study the process itself as methodology
- **Collaborate**: Work with others on shared concepts
- **Teach**: Help others implement similar approaches

Or none of the above. The project guides itself through what proves interesting and valuable.
