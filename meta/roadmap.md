**Success metric**: 10 polished, outlet-ready op-eds

### 2. Begin Media Outreach

**Goal**: Secure first 3-5 placements in Tier 3 outlets

**Target Outlets** (Tier 3 - Easiest entry):
- The Hill (Congressional staffers read religiously)
- Politico (insider-focused)
- Medium partner publications
- Established Substack guest posts
- Think tank blogs (Brookings, AEI, CSIS)

**Success metric**: First 3 op-eds placed by February 2026

### 3. Build Social Media Presence

**Goal**: Grow following and engagement on all platforms

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create T3 social posts for each pillar
- [ ] Generate T4 hooks for Twitter/X
- [ ] Post weekly on LinkedIn with links to essays
- [ ] Engage with policy journalists and thought leaders
- [ ] Cross-promote on Bluesky

**Success metric**: 1,000+ followers across platforms by February 2026

### 4. Tool Refinement (As Needed)

**Goal**: Make tools work for actual workflow

**Priority Tools**:
- `validate_post` - For publication workflow
- `citation_formatter` - For research references
- Visual creation pipeline (Canva templates)

**Success metric**: Can produce and publish content without manual friction

---

## Medium-Term Goals (March - August 2026)

### 5. Scale Media Placements

**Goal**: Move from Tier 3 to Tier 2 outlets

**Target Outlets** (Tier 2):
- Bloomberg Opinion
- Washington Post Opinions
- Financial Times Opinion
- Substack features/recommendations

**Approach**:
- Use Tier 3 clips as credibility
- Build relationships with editors
- Pitch timely pieces tied to current events

### 6. Podcast Circuit

**Goal**: Secure 5+ podcast appearances

**Target Podcasts**:
- The Weeds (Vox - policy nerds)
- The Bulwark (anti-Trump conservatives)
- Breaking Points (populist appeal)
- Emerging policy podcasts

### 7. Complete Remaining Pillar Essays

**Goal**: Finish Phase I content base

**Remaining Pillars**:
- The Tariff Delusion (timely, economic pragmatism)
- The Accountability Architecture (systems showcase)
- The Sovereignty Stack (tech credentials)

**Success metric**: 7-8 total pillar essays published

## Long-Term Goals (6-12 Months)

### 7. Build Concept Framework

**Goal**: Create reusable analytical frameworks

**Examples**:
- Framework for analyzing institutional incentives
- Framework for evaluating accountability mechanisms
- Framework for assessing information flow
- Framework for measuring democratic legitimacy

These frameworks get applied to multiple specific concepts.

### 8. Develop Interconnected Concept Network

**Goal**: Show how concepts build on each other

**Visualization**:
- Concept dependency graph
- Term usage across concepts
- Research source connections
- Conversation topic evolution

### 9. Publish Compilation

**Goal**: Create a coherent whole from developed concepts

**Format**: Long-form essay or short book combining:
- Published concepts
- Frameworks
- Meta-commentary on the process
- What we learned

**Not**: A finished manifesto, but a snapshot of thinking-in-progress

### 10. Tool Ecosystem Maturity

**Goal**: Tools are robust, tested, well-documented

**Tasks**:
- Full test coverage
- Example inputs/outputs
- Video demonstrations
- Third-party usage
- Tool-specific documentation sites

## Open Questions

Things we don't know yet and need to figure out:

### Process Questions

- How many draft iterations is typical?
- How long should concepts "marinate" before publishing?
- When should concepts be split vs. merged?
- How to handle evolving glossary terms referenced in old drafts?

### Tooling Questions

- Should tools be extracted to separate repo?
- Should there be a web interface for validation?
- Should conversation conversion be more automated?
- Should we build analysis tools for concept relationships?

### Content Questions

- What's the right scope for a single concept?
- How much historical context is needed?
- How to balance theory vs. practical application?
- When to address political feasibility vs. ideal design?

### Community Questions

- How to handle substantive disagreements?
- Should there be a discussion forum?
- How to credit intellectual contributions?
- What's the process for major forks?

## Things We're Explicitly Not Doing

**At least not yet**:

### Not Building

- Web platform (markdown + git is sufficient)
- Social features (use GitHub issues/discussions)
- Publishing platform (focus on content, not distribution)
- Video content (text is the primary medium)

### Not Pursuing

- Academic publication (different goals)
- Mainstream media coverage (not the point)
- Consensus-building (enable branching instead)
- Comprehensive coverage (depth over breadth)

### Not Claiming

- Finished solutions (this is ongoing thinking)
- Novel discoveries (building on existing work)
- Ideological neutrality (have a perspective, document it)
- Universal applicability (context matters)

## Success Metrics

How we'll know if this is working:

### Quality Indicators

- Concepts survive critique and improve from it
- Reasoning is traceable and logical
- Research is thorough and well-cited
- Process is clear and followable

### Engagement Indicators

- Issues raised that improve thinking
- Forks that extend ideas in new directions
- Tools used by others for similar projects
- Research contributions from others

### Personal Indicators

- Understanding deepens through the process
- Writing becomes clearer
- Arguments become stronger
- Willingness to change mind when wrong

**Not measuring**: Page views, social media mentions, mainstream adoption

## How This Roadmap Changes

This roadmap itself will evolve:

- **Monthly reviews**: Check progress, adjust priorities
- **Quarterly updates**: Major revisions based on what's working
- **Document changes**: Git history shows how plans evolved
- **Explain changes**: Commit messages say why priorities shifted

The roadmap is a living document, not a contract.

## Contributing to the Roadmap

Want to influence where this goes?

- **Open issues**: Suggest topics to explore
- **Contribute research**: Add sources for future concepts
- **Challenge priorities**: Explain why something else matters more
- **Share tools**: Build something that extends the workflow

The roadmap responds to what proves valuable.

## Timeline Disclaimer

These timeframes are **aspirational**, not promises.

Real factors affecting pace:
- Full-time work (this is a side project)
- Research depth (some topics require more digging)
- Iteration needs (some concepts need more drafts)
- Life circumstances (things happen)

Quality over speed. If a concept needs more time, it gets more time.

## What Comes After?

Beyond 12 months is too hazy to plan specifically, but potential directions:

- **Scale up**: More concepts, deeper exploration
- **Scale out**: Apply process to adjacent domains
- **Scale meta**: Study the process itself as methodology
- **Collaborate**: Work with others on shared concepts
- **Teach**: Help others implement similar approaches

Or none of the above. The project guides itself through what proves interesting and valuable.
