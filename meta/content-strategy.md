# Content Strategy: The Tiered Framework

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: November 12, 2025

---

## Overview

The Statecraft Blueprint uses a tiered content strategy to maximize impact and reach. Each pillar essay (T1) generates 7-15 pieces of derived content across multiple tiers, creating a multiplier effect.

**Core Formula**: 5-7 Pillar Essays → 50-100 Derived Content Pieces

---

## The Five Content Tiers

### Tier 1: The Foundation
**Format**: 2,500-4,000 words
**Purpose**: The full, academic, source-of-truth argument
**Audience**: Deep thinkers, policy professionals, academics
**Platform**: Substack (statecraftblueprint.org)

**Structure**:
- Hook/Introduction (200-300 words)
- Section I: Root Cause Analysis (600-800 words)
- Section II: Mechanics of Failure (600-800 words)
- Section III: Why Current Solutions Fail (400-600 words)
- Section IV: The Engineering Solution (600-800 words)
- Conclusion: The Blueprint Mandate (200-300 words)

**Style Notes**:
- Use subheadings liberally
- Include specific examples and data
- Cite sources (even if informal)
- Bold key concepts on first use
- End sections with transition sentences

**Examples**:
- Legislative Servitude (P1.1)
- Unavoidable Nuance (P2.1.1)
- Five-Stage Cascade (P3.1.1)

---

### Tier 2: The Traditional Op-Ed
**Format**: 750-1,000 words
**Purpose**: Traditional media placement (print/long-form online)
**Audience**: Educated general public, political influencers
**Platform**: Washington Post, The Atlantic, Bloomberg, The Hill, etc.

**The Classic Op-Ed Formula**:

1. **Lede** (100-150 words)
   - Start with current event or vivid example
   - State your argument immediately
   - Hook in first 2 sentences

2. **The Problem** (200-250 words)
   - Establish what's broken
   - One powerful example
   - Data point if available

3. **Why It Matters** (150-200 words)
   - Connect to reader's life
   - Show stakes
   - Create urgency

4. **Your Solution** (250-300 words)
   - One clear proposal
   - Explain how it works
   - Preempt one major objection

5. **The Closer** (100-150 words)
   - Return to opening image/example
   - Make it personal or universal
   - Call to action (subtle)

**Style Notes**:
- ONE idea only - resist urge to solve everything
- Active voice, short sentences
- No jargon - define technical terms immediately
- Conversational but authoritative
- No bullet points (editors hate them)

**Example**: "Congress's Public Voting System Is a Lobbyist's Dream" (from Legislative Servitude)

---

### Tier 3: The Digital Core
**Format**: 150-300 words (1-3 paragraphs)
**Purpose**: High-impact social media posts
**Audience**: Social media users, newsletter readers
**Platform**: LinkedIn, X/Twitter threads, newsletter sections

**Formula**:
1. Hook sentence - provocative claim or vivid image
2. Mechanism explanation - how the system actually works
3. Consequence - what this means in practice
4. Punch line - memorable closer that reframes the issue

**This is your "quotable paragraph"** - the thing people screenshot, copy-paste, and share.

**Example** (from Legislative Servitude):
> "The brilliance of the private ballot is protection from coercion. Yet, our legislators don't have it. Their public vote ledger is the perfect tool for lobbyists to deliver instant reprisal—draining funds or revoking committee posts. The result isn't just a compromised vote; it's a political extinction threat, turning public servants into legislative slaves."

**Additional Variant Types**:
- **Economic Angle**: Focus on costs, incentives, market dynamics
- **Historical Angle**: Show how we solved similar problems before
- **Systems Angle**: Explain feedback loops and structural dynamics

---

### Tier 4: The Micro-Hook
**Format**: Single sentence/bullet point/visual
**Purpose**: Maximum shareability and "regurgitation"
**Audience**: Mass social media
**Platform**: Twitter/X, headlines, memes, presentation titles

**Types of T4 Hooks**:

1. **The Provocative Reframe**:
   - "We gave Congress transparency and got legislative slavery instead."
   - "The Sunshine Act doesn't expose corruption—it enables it."

2. **The Systems Insight**:
   - "Congress is structurally designed to reward purity and punish consensus."
   - "Legislative paralysis isn't a bug; it's a feature."

3. **The Call to Action**:
   - "If private ballots protect voters from coercion, why not legislators?"
   - "We banned public voting in 1890. Time to finish the job."

4. **The Stat/Fact Bomb**:
   - "$4 billion in lobbying ÷ 535 legislators = $7.5 million per member."

5. **The Visceral Image**:
   - "Imagine voting with your boss's hand on your shoulder. That's Congress."

**Usage**:
- Tweet the hook + link to T3 or T2
- Thread opener: Hook → Thread → Link to T1
- Video title
- Presentation slide title
- Interview opener/closer

---

### Tier 5: The Visual
**Format**: Infographic, diagram, data visualization, meme
**Purpose**: Visual explanation and sharing
**Audience**: All audiences (cross-platform)
**Platform**: All social media, presentations, newsletters

**For Each Pillar, Create**:

1. **The System Diagram**
   - Shows causal chain
   - Example: Lobbyist → Public Vote Record → Retaliation → Legislative Capture → Policy Gridlock
   - Style: Clean, professional, not meme-y

2. **The Data Visualization**
   - One key statistic visualized
   - Example: Correlation between public voting records and committee changes

3. **The Comparison Graphic**
   - Before/After or Current/Proposed
   - Example: "Private Ballot (Citizens)" vs "Public Ballot (Congress)"

4. **The Meme/Social**
   - More casual, shareable
   - Example: Two-panel comic showing voter privacy vs. legislator transparency

5. **The Quote Card**
   - Best T4 hook on visually appealing background
   - Branded with site name

**Tools**:
- Canva (easy, template-based)
- Adobe Express (similar)
- Figma (more professional)
- Flourish, Datawrapper (for charts)

## Content Derivation Per Pillar

From each T1 pillar essay, generate **7-15 pieces**:

| Content Type | Count | Purpose |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| T1 Pillar Essay | 1 | Source of truth |
| Executive Summary | 1 | TL;DR version (500 words) |
| T2 Op-eds | 2-3 | Media placements, different angles |
| T3 Social Posts | 2-3 | LinkedIn, Twitter threads |
| T4 Hooks | 5-10 | Headlines, tweets, memes |
| T5 Visuals | 3-5 | Infographics, diagrams, quote cards |
| Talking Points | 1-2 | Interviews, conversations |
| Video Scripts | 1 | 3-5 min explainer |
| Response Pieces | 2-3 | Connect to current events |

**Multiplier Effect**: 7 pillars × 10 derived pieces = 70+ content pieces

- "200 years of economic evidence says tariffs don't work"

**T5 Visuals**:
- Infographic: "Who Really Pays Tariffs?" (money flow visualization)

## Production Workflow

### Stage 1: Deep Thinking
1. Create outline (P#.#.Out)
2. Write T1 draft
3. Refine T1 based on self-critique

### Stage 2: Distillation
4. Extract core argument into T3 (the quotable paragraph)
5. Generate 5-10 T4 hooks from T1 and T3
6. Identify 2-3 different angles for T2 op-eds

### Stage 3: Production
7. Write T2 variants (different angles, different outlets)
8. Create visual assets (T5)
9. Package everything for distribution

### Stage 4: Distribution
10. Publish T1 on Substack
11. Pitch T2s to outlets
12. Post T3+T4 on social with link to T1
13. Respond to engagement, create T3 variants based on questions

## The "Wedge" Strategy

Don't try to go straight to NYT Opinion. Instead:

**Month 1-3**: Publish on Substack, build initial audience
**Month 3-6**: Guest post on established Substacks, get co-authors from think tanks
**Month 6-9**: Place op-eds in Tier 3 outlets (The Hill, Medium partner pubs)
**Month 9-12**: Armed with clips, pitch Tier 2 (Bloomberg, WaPo)
**Month 12-18**: With established credibility, pitch Tier 1 (Foreign Affairs, Atlantic)

---

## Key Relationships to Build

Target these types of people for outreach:

1. **Think tank fellows** - Working on democracy reform, tech policy, economic policy
2. **Journalists** - Who cover your topics (follow, engage thoughtfully)
3. **Podcast producers** - Desperate for interesting, articulate guests
4. **Other Substack writers** - In adjacent spaces (cross-promotion)
5. **Congressional staffers** - Young, online, actually write the bills
