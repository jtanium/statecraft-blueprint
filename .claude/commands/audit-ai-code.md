# Audit AI-Generated Code

Scan the repository for AI-generated code and generate a comprehensive audit report.

## Task

Search for AI-generated code markers and headers throughout the repository and create a detailed report showing:

1. **Files with AI-generated headers** - Complete new files generated by AI
2. **Files with inline AI markers** - Files with partial AI modifications
3. **Review status breakdown** - Count of UNREVIEWED, IN REVIEW, TESTED, REVIEWED, PRODUCTION READY
4. **Unreviewed code locations** - Specific files and line numbers that need review
5. **Code without proper markers** - Any AI-generated code missing headers (if detectable)

## Search Patterns

Look for:
- `AI-GENERATED CODE - NOT REVIEWED OR TESTED` (file headers)
- `BEGIN AI-GENERATED CODE` (inline markers)
- `END AI-GENERATED CODE` (inline markers)
- `Status: UNREVIEWED`
- `Status: IN REVIEW`
- `Status: TESTED`
- `Status: REVIEWED`
- `Status: PRODUCTION READY`

## Output Format

Generate a report in this format:

```markdown
# AI-Generated Code Audit Report
Generated: [timestamp]

## Summary
- Total files with AI code: X
- Complete AI-generated files: X
- Partially modified files: X
- Total AI code blocks: X

## Review Status
- ❌ UNREVIEWED: X files/blocks
- ⚠️  IN REVIEW: X files/blocks
- 🧪 TESTED: X files/blocks
- ✅ REVIEWED: X files/blocks
- 🚀 PRODUCTION READY: X files/blocks

## Files Requiring Review

### Complete Files (UNREVIEWED)
1. path/to/file.rb - Generated [date]
2. path/to/file.py - Generated [date]

### Partial Modifications (UNREVIEWED)
1. path/to/file.rb
   - Lines 45-67: Error handling logic
   - Lines 102-115: Data processing

## All AI-Generated Code

[Complete list with file paths, line numbers, and status]

## Recommendations

[Suggest priority items for review based on file importance]
```

## Additional Analysis

- Identify the oldest unreviewed code (by timestamp)
- Flag any AI-generated code in critical paths (if identifiable)
- Note any inconsistencies in header format

## Notes

- Only scan actual code files (ignore markdown docs, unless they contain code blocks)
- Search both in working directory and subdirectories
- Include git status for modified files
- Be thorough - this is for safety and tracking
