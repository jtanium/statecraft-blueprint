# Governance Architecture

*Status: Early Development*

## Overview

This concept explores how to design government institutions from first principles, focusing on the structural elements that determine whether institutions actually serve their stated purposes.

## Core Question

How do you design institutional structures that maintain accountability, enable effective action, and resist corruption over time?

## Key Themes

- Accountability mechanisms and their failure modes
- Information flow within institutions
- Incentive structures and their unintended consequences
- Separation of powers vs. coordination needs
- Democratic legitimacy vs. technical competence

## Current Status

**Phase**: Initial exploration and outline development

**Completed**:
- Initial brainstorming conversations
- Preliminary outline
- Research source identification

**In Progress**:
- Deepening theoretical framework
- Gathering historical examples
- First draft development

**Next Steps**:
- Complete draft v1.0
- Add more case studies
- Address counterarguments
