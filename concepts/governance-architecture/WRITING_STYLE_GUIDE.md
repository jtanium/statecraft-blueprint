# Statecraft Blueprint - Writing Style Guide
*How to present complex ideas while avoiding unproductive policy debates*

---

## Core Mission

We're doing **second-order work**: creating conditions where policy debates can lead somewhere. We're not pre-deciding solutions—we're opening space where solutions can be considered and implemented.

**What we ARE doing:**
- **Pointing out undeniable problems** - the things we can all see and agree are problems (government shutdowns, political gridlock, policy whiplash), even if we disagree on causes and solutions
- Spreading awareness that solutions to these problems exist
- Showing the system itself can be changed
- Building a "big tent" for people who believe structural reform is necessary

**What we're NOT doing:**
- Advocating for specific policies (yet)
- Debating which particular reforms are best
- Getting bogged down in implementation details

### The Foundation: Start with Undeniable Problems

Every piece should begin with a problem that transcends partisan divides:
- **Government shutdowns** - Everyone agrees these are dysfunctional, regardless of who they blame
- **Political gridlock** - Both sides are frustrated by inability to get things done
- **Policy whiplash** - Businesses and citizens can't plan when policy lurches every 4-8 years
- **Recurring crises** - The same problems keep happening with no resolution

These are the problems we can all *see*, even if we disagree about what caused them or how to fix them. Start here.

## The Core Tension: Abstract vs. Concrete

### The Problem
- **Too abstract**: "We need constitutional reform" → People glaze over, can't grasp it
- **Too concrete**: "Here's ranked choice voting" → People fixate on debating that specific thing

### The Solution Framework

#### 1. **Lead with the Problem, Not the Solution**

Open with the **systemic failure** that's undeniable across ideologies before introducing any potential solutions.

**Example Pattern:**
> "Whether you love or hate tariffs, everyone agrees our trade policy lurches wildly based on who's president, making it impossible for businesses to plan. Here's ONE way this could be addressed—but the real point is we COULD address it if we weren't locked into this structure."

#### 2. **Use Multiple Diverse Examples**

Instead of one example (which becomes THE thing to debate), show 3-4 very different examples to signal "these are illustrations of what's possible, not a platform."

**Example Pattern:**
> "Some people advocate for X, others for Y, still others for Z—the point is the current system blocks all of them."

#### 3. **Explicit "This Is Illustrative" Language**

Meta-frame examples as you present them. Use consistent framing language:

**Standard Phrases to Use:**
- "Here's ONE example to make this concrete—not a proposal we're advocating for..."
- "EXAMPLE SCENARIO: [Your example here]"
- "ONE POSSIBLE APPROACH (among many):"
- "This is a thought experiment, not gospel..."
- "To illustrate the concept..."

**Consider:**
- Using visual formatting (callouts, sidebars, italics) to set examples apart
- Labeling sections as "ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE" or "SCENARIO"

#### 4. **The "Choose Your Own Adventure" Framing**

Present structural change as enabling choice, not imposing solutions.

**Example Pattern:**
> "Some people think we need X. Others prefer Y. The current system gives us neither—it just gives us chaos every 4-8 years. We're not here to pick winners, we're here to say: shouldn't we be able to actually CHOOSE instead of being stuck with 18th-century defaults?"

#### 5. **Redirect the Debate Energy**

When readers want to debate specifics (and they will), have ready redirects:

**Standard Redirects:**
- "That's exactly the kind of conversation we SHOULD be having as a society—but right now, we can't even have it because the system won't allow any of these options. That's what we're trying to change first."
- "Do you agree that our current system makes it nearly impossible for good ideas—whatever they are—to become reality? That's what we're fixing first."
- "The question isn't whether [specific policy] is perfect—it's whether we should be permanently stuck with a system that can't implement ANY improvements."

## Voice & Tone Standards

### The Stoic Brand
- **Calm and measured**: Never alarmist, never breathless
- **Analytically rigorous**: Show your work, cite your sources
- **Intellectually honest**: Acknowledge complexity and trade-offs
- **Non-partisan by design**: Frame as system problems, not people problems

### Accessibility Without Condescension
- **For "less sophisticated readers"** without ever treating them as less intelligent
- **Down-to-earth person** speaking to other down-to-earth people
- **Avoid academic jargon** - when technical terms are necessary, explain them
- **Short sentences for complex ideas** - clarity over sophistication

### The Systems Thinker Voice
- **Engineering mindset**: How does this mechanism work? What are the incentives?
- **First-principles analysis**: Break it down to fundamentals
- **Root cause focus**: Why does the system produce this outcome?
- **Solution-oriented**: What can be built, not just what's broken

### Bipartisan Empathy
- **Progressive who understands conservatism**
- **Show how system failures hurt everyone**
- **Empathetic to people trapped in the system** - it's not their fault
- **No tribal signaling** - avoid language that triggers partisan identity

---

## Structure Preferences

### Opening Strategy
- **Lead with insight, not throat-clearing**
- **Start with an undeniable problem** everyone recognizes
- **Hook with emotion/urgency** before diving into mechanism
- **Use concrete, current examples** when possible (but watch for time-sensitivity)

### Body Architecture
- **Use descriptive subheadings** for scannability
- **Short paragraphs** (3-5 sentences max for most)
- **Concrete examples** to illustrate abstract concepts
- **Active voice preferred**
- **Technical precision** with accessibility

### Lists and Formatting
- **Use lists sparingly** - prefer prose for analysis and explanation
- **When lists are needed:**
  - Use CommonMark markdown
  - Make each bullet 1-2 sentences minimum
  - Never use lists in casual/empathetic conversations
- **Bold key facts** for scannability
- **Minimize formatting** - don't over-format with headers and bold everywhere

### Conclusions
- **Action-oriented** - tell readers what this means for them
- **Provide hope and agency** - readers should feel energized
- **Acknowledge difficulty** honestly - no false solutions
- **Clear next steps** or invitations to engage further

## Content Standards

### What We Always Do
- ✅ Identify system failures (not just symptoms)
- ✅ Trace root causes (why does the system produce this outcome?)
- ✅ Propose structural solutions (engineer better systems)
- ✅ Show the work (evidence, citations, logic)
- ✅ Acknowledge trade-offs and complexity
- ✅ Frame as design problems, not people problems
- ✅ Give people permission to imagine different systems

### What We Never Do
- ❌ Pretend solutions are simple
- ❌ Blame individuals for structural problems
- ❌ Use tribal/partisan language
- ❌ Oversimplify for emotional impact
- ❌ Hide uncertainty or limitations
- ❌ Make promises about easy fixes
- ❌ Advocate for specific policies without acknowledging alternatives

---

## Special Considerations

### Reaching Across the Spectrum
The challenge: People on both sides are trapped in constrained thinking—it can feel like talking to "religious" believers. But they're trapped by the system, not stupid.

**Approach:**
- **Meet them where they are** - acknowledge their real concerns
- **Show how current system fails their goals** too
- **Make it safe to think differently** - "this isn't about betraying your values"
- **Emphasize shared frustration** with dysfunction
- **Frame as pragmatic engineering**, not ideology

### When Ideas Are "Too Abstract"
If readers say "this is too abstract" or "I don't get it":
- ✅ Add more concrete examples (but labeled as illustrative)
- ✅ Use metaphors and analogies
- ✅ Tell stories or use scenarios
- ❌ Don't simplify the actual argument
- ❌ Don't remove necessary complexity

### When Readers Want to Debate Policy
This is actually a **good sign** - they're engaged and thinking. But redirect:

1. **Acknowledge their engagement**: "I'm glad this resonated enough for you to think deeply about implementation..."
2. **Validate the question**: "That's exactly the kind of question we need to be asking..."
3. **Redirect to meta-level**: "...but right now we can't even have that conversation because [systemic barrier]"
4. **Reinforce the mission**: "We're trying to create the conditions where these debates can actually lead to action"

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing, ask:

- [ ] **Does this lead with an undeniable problem?** (Something everyone can see and agree is dysfunctional, regardless of who they blame)
- [ ] **Will this make someone ask "huh, why IS it that way?"** (Making the invisible visible)
- [ ] Are examples clearly labeled as illustrative?
- [ ] Could someone from either political side find value here?
- [ ] Is the tone stoic and analytical, not emotional or preachy?
- [ ] Are we showing the work (evidence, logic, citations)?
- [ ] Have we avoided getting stuck in specific policy debates?
- [ ] Is it accessible without being condescending?
- [ ] Does it end with hope and agency?
- [ ] Would a "less sophisticated reader" understand the core point?
- [ ] Have we acknowledged complexity and trade-offs honestly?

## Example Transformation

### ❌ Before (Too Abstract)
"We need constitutional reform to fix our broken system."

### ❌ Before (Too Concrete) 
"Here's my 12-point plan for constitutional amendments, starting with ranked choice voting..."

### ✅ After (Just Right)
"Whether you care about climate change, immigration, healthcare, or the debt, everyone agrees Congress can't address any of these challenges effectively. Some experts think ranked choice voting could help. Others advocate for changes to the Senate. Still others propose new mechanisms for constitutional amendments. These are all different visions—but here's what they have in common: under our current system, none of them can even get a serious hearing. That's the problem we're trying to solve first."

## Remember

**The Goal:** Start conversations. Get people thinking. Show that change is possible.

**The Anti-Goal:** Win policy debates. Convince people your specific solution is best.

**Measures of Success:**
- Reader says **"Huh, why IS it that way?"** - You've made them notice something they took for granted
- Reader says **"Yeah, I never noticed that - we should do something about that"** - You've converted a background assumption into a visible problem
- Reader says **"I never thought about it that way"** - You've reframed their understanding
- Reader says **"We should be able to do better than this"** - You've created permission to imagine alternatives

**NOT a measure of success:**
- "I agree with your 12-point plan" - Too concrete, premature policy debate
