# Governance Architecture - Outline

*Draft v0.1*

## Core Thesis

Government institutions fail not because of bad people, but because of bad architecture. Like buildings, institutions have structural elements that determine their function—and structural flaws that predict their failures.

## Main Argument

1. **Institutions are designed systems** (not natural phenomena)
2. **Design choices have consequences** (predictable failure modes)
3. **Architecture matters more than personnel** (structure shapes behavior)
4. **Most institutional failures are architectural** (not moral)

## Outline Structure

### I. Introduction: The Architecture Metaphor

Why think about government like we think about building design?

### II. What Is Governance Architecture?

Defining the concept and its components.

### III. Accountability Architecture

How institutions maintain accountability (or fail to).

### IV. Information Architecture

How information flows (or doesn't) within institutions.

### V. Incentive Architecture

How institutional structures shape motivations.

### VI. Case Studies

Historical and contemporary examples.

### VII. Design Principles

Synthesizing lessons into actionable principles.

### VIII. Implementation Challenges

Why good architecture is hard to achieve.

### IX. Conclusion

What changes when we think architecturally about governance?
