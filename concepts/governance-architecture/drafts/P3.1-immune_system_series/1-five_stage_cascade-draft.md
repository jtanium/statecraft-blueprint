# The Five-Stage Cascade: How I Watched Economic Nonsense Become Policy in Real-Time

**Part 1 of 3: The Immune System Series**

---

September 5, 2024. I'm watching the Economic Club of New York event. Former President Trump is speaking to a room full of business leaders—people who understand economics, who've built companies, who know how trade works.

Reshma Saujani, founder of Girls Who Code, asks a straightforward question about childcare costs. She cites the numbers: $122 billion annually, costing more than rent for working families, preventing women from joining the workforce. She asks what specific legislation he would prioritize to make childcare affordable.

The answer that follows is... I'm still not sure how to describe it. Something about tariffs. And "taxing foreign nations at levels they're not used to." And childcare being "relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we'll be taking in." And eliminating deficits. And waste and fraud.

I watched it twice to make sure I heard it correctly. (You can watch the full exchange yourself on [C-SPAN](https://www.c-span.org/clip/campaign-2024/user-clip-trumps-answer-to-childcare-question-at-the-economic-club-of-new-york/5132936) or read the [PBS coverage](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-trump-delivers-remarks-at-economic-club-of-new-york-luncheon).)

My immediate thought: "That makes no economic sense whatsoever."

My second thought: "Of course no one's going to challenge this. They never do."

And I was right. But what I didn't know yet was that I was about to watch something far more disturbing than one unchallenged incoherent answer. I was about to watch a lie become policy in five predictable stages.

## Addressing the Elephant in the Room

I need to be direct about something: Most of my examples in this series involve Trump and Republicans. I wish I had perfect equivalence—matching Democratic examples for every Republican one. But I don't, and I'm not going to manufacture false balance just to seem neutral.

Why? Because **false equivalence is part of the problem I'm diagnosing.** 

When media gives equal time to climate science and climate denial, that's Stage 2 of the cascade I'm about to show you—translating nonsense into legitimate discourse. When journalists treat "the earth is warming due to human activity" and "windmills cause cancer" as equally valid perspectives deserving equal coverage, they're not being neutral. They're being part of the system failure.

If I did the same thing here just to avoid seeming partisan, I'd be committing the exact error I'm critiquing.

So here's what I can honestly say:
- **Both parties do economically questionable things** 
- **Both parties oversimplify complex issues** 
- **The system rewards this behavior regardless of party**
- **But the frequency, scale, and brazenness varies**

I'm using the tariff example because:
1. **I watched it happen in real-time** (personal experience grounds it)
2. **It's recent and clear** (easy to verify, fresh in memory)
3. **It perfectly illustrates the five-stage cascade** (pedagogically ideal)
4. **It affects all of us—both sides of the aisle, young and old.** Conservative farmers lose export markets. Progressive consumers face higher prices. Small businesses get crushed by supply chain chaos. The only people it affects disproportionately are those with enough wealth to not notice grocery prices. **This isn't partisan—it's economic reality.**

If you can show me equivalent Democratic examples, I genuinely want to hear them. But I won't pretend they're equally common or equally brazen just to maintain false balance. That would undermine everything I'm trying to build here: **credibility through intellectual honesty.**

Focus on the mechanism, not the person. The cascade is the problem. Trump just makes it visible.

Now, let me show you what I saw.

## Stage 1: Initial Nonsense (No Filter at Point of Origin)

Here's what happened at the Economic Club forum:

A serious policy question received a two-minute answer that mixed unrelated concepts with no causal mechanism connecting them:
- Tariffs (but called "taxing other countries")
- Childcare costs (the actual question)
- General prosperity ("it's relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we'll be taking in")
- Deficit elimination
- Waste and fraud reduction

No explanation of how A leads to B. No economic logic. Just... word association. (The Washington Post also [covered the exchange](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/05/trump-tariffs-child-care-costs/) and called it a "confusing answer.")

I understand economics. I've spent time learning how trade works, how tariffs function, what tax incidence means. So I knew immediately: **tariffs are taxes paid by domestic importers, not foreign countries.**[^5] They raise prices for American consumers. They don't "fund" anything that wouldn't be better funded by literally any other revenue mechanism.

Here's what should have happened in that room:

**Option 1:** Moderator interrupts: "I'm sorry, can you clarify how tariffs would specifically address childcare costs? Can you walk us through the mechanism?"

**Option 2:** Other panelists challenge: "That's not how tariffs work. They're paid by domestic importers, not foreign governments."

**Option 3:** Audience pushback: Visible confusion, follow-up questions, someone asking for specifics.

**Option 4:** Real-time fact-checking: "The candidate has just made a claim that contradicts basic economics."

Here's what actually happened:

Polite applause. No challenge. Forum continues. Everyone moves on as if a policy position had been stated.

Reshma Saujani, the questioner, later said the answer "blew my mind" and was "incomprehensible."[^1] Brian Riedl, a conservative economist at the Manhattan Institute, called it "rambling gibberish" and "incoherent word salad."[^2]

But in the moment? Silence. The system had no immune response at the point of entry.

**This is the critical failure.** Our political system has no filter that says "wait, this violates basic economics." That room was full of financial experts who almost certainly recognized the nonsense. But social norms, media norms, and institutional norms all prevent calling out incoherence in real-time.

The infection began here. And there was no defense.

---

## Stage 2: Media Translation (Nonsense Becomes "News")

Over the next 24-48 hours, I watched the news coverage evolve.

Journalists had a problem: How do you report on an incoherent answer? If you write "Candidate gives rambling, economically illiterate response to childcare question," you sound partisan. You sound like you're editorializing. You risk losing access.

So the media did what it's trained to do: extract signal from noise. Find the "policy position." Make sense of the senseless.

**The translation process:**
- **Input:** Two minutes of word salad mixing tariffs, childcare, deficits, and prosperity with no connecting logic
- **Media processing:** "What was he trying to say? What's the concrete policy element here?"
- **Output:** "Trump proposes using tariff revenue to address childcare costs"

Watch what happened: The lie became structured.

Headlines shifted from describing incoherence to describing policy:
- "Trump suggests tariffs can reduce child care costs" (PBS)
- "Trump claims boosting tariffs will pay for child care" (CNN)
- "Trump proposes tariffs to fund childcare" (multiple outlets)

The incoherence was smoothed away. The economic impossibility was framed as a "controversial proposal" or a "plan that economists debate."

**Why does this happen?**

It's not because journalists are stupid or malicious. It's because the incentive structure makes this the rational choice:

- **Calling it incoherent = risky:** Seems biased, might lose access, gets you labeled as "in the tank" for one side
- **Reporting it as policy = safe:** Maintains the appearance of neutrality, preserves access, follows professional norms
- **Controversy = profitable:** "Trump's childcare plan sparks debate" gets more clicks than "Candidate gives incoherent answer"

**Here's the critical insight:** By treating nonsense as a legitimate policy position worthy of debate, the media gave it legitimacy. 

The word "tariffs" started appearing everywhere. Not "incoherent answer." Not "economically illiterate response." Just... tariffs. A thing. A policy. Something real enough to discuss.

Stage 2 complete. The lie now has structure, has legitimacy, has entered the discourse as something real rather than something nonsensical.

## Stage 3: Viral Spread (Optimized for Replication, Not Accuracy)

Within days, a soundbite emerged: "Tax other countries to pay for childcare."

Notice what makes this perfectly viral:
- **Simple:** Fits in a tweet, a chyron, a conversation
- **Emotionally satisfying:** "Make them pay for us" taps into economic anxiety and nationalism  
- **Zero understanding required:** You can repeat it without knowing what a tariff is
- **Tribal signaling:** Becomes an identity marker, not a policy position

This is where I started to feel the frustration viscerally. I'd see it everywhere:
- Social media posts
- Conversations at work
- Family members mentioning it
- People who couldn't explain what a tariff *is* advocating for tariffs

I tried explaining. "Actually, that's not how it works. Tariffs are paid by domestic importers who pass the cost to consumers. It's effectively a sales tax. We pay it, not China."

But my explanation required:
- Stopping to focus (in an attention economy)
- Understanding multiple steps (importer pays → cost passed to consumer → prices rise)
- Trusting me over "everyone else"
- Accepting something counterintuitive ("taxing other countries" sounds right)

The lie required nothing. It was free. It was simple. It felt true.

**This is asymmetric warfare.** Truth requires effort. Lies are free.

The lie spread at the speed of social media—instant, viral, exponential. My explanations moved at the speed of careful reasoning—slow, complex, limited reach.

Each share of the lie required zero verification. Each correction required paragraphs of explanation. Each person who repeated it paid no cost for being wrong. Each person who fact-checked it paid the cost of time, effort, and social friction.

**We have systems optimized for virality but no immune system for accuracy.** The most shareable idea wins, regardless of truth.

The discourse had been hijacked. And I was just one person watching it happen, unable to stop it.

---

## Stage 4: Social Proof Cascade ("Everyone Knows This")

Here's where it gets really insidious.

After a few weeks of saturation coverage, something shifts. The lie achieves escape velocity. It's not just a claim anymore—it's part of the discourse. "Everyone's talking about tariffs."

This triggers a psychological mechanism: **If everyone's discussing it, it must be a real thing.**

"Smart people wouldn't all be talking about nonsense, right? It's been in the news for weeks, surely someone checked the facts. If it were completely wrong, someone would have said something by now."

**Social proof substitutes for verification.**

Consider the cost structure:

**Cost of being informed about tariffs:**
- Must understand: international trade, tariff mechanics, tax incidence, deadweight loss, retaliatory policy
- Time investment: Hours of reading economics
- Cognitive load: High complexity, multiple concepts
- Social cost: You become "that guy" correcting everyone
- Personal benefit: Zero (your understanding doesn't change policy)

**Cost of repeating the talking point:**
- Understanding required: Zero
- Time investment: 30 seconds
- Cognitive load: None
- Social benefit: Fits in, signals tribal membership
- Personal benefit: Zero (same as being informed)

**This is rational ignorance.** For most people, being informed changes nothing in their lives. One vote has negligible impact. Understanding trade policy won't help them pay bills. So why invest hours learning economics when you can spend that time with your kids?

The system creates this outcome. This isn't a character flaw—it's system design.

I watched people who couldn't explain what a tariff *is* confidently advocate for tariffs. When I tried to explain, I got: "Well, everyone says..." or "I heard that..." or "But wouldn't it be good to make other countries pay?"

The discourse had shifted from "Is this true?" to "Which implementation?" The lie had won before truth could even suit up.

---

## Stage 5: Failed Corrections (Truth Too Slow, Too Complex, Too Late)

So I tried. I really did.

I explained to friends, family, coworkers: "Here's how tariffs actually work. The U.S. importer pays the tariff to the U.S. government when goods enter the country. The importer passes that cost to consumers through higher prices. We've seen this pattern repeatedly—Smoot-Hawley in the 1930s,[^6] the 2018-2019 trade war.[^7] There's near-universal economist consensus on this."

Here's what I was asking people to do:
1. Stop what they're doing and focus
2. Understand a multi-step economic mechanism
3. Question authority (media, politicians, social proof)
4. Admit they might have been wrong
5. Accept an uncomfortable truth (economic nationalism doesn't work like you think)
6. Trust me over "everyone else"

**Why did it fail?**

**The timing asymmetry:** By the time I had formulated my explanation, the lie had already saturated the discourse. I was trying to bail water from a flooded boat.

**The complexity barrier:** My explanation required effort. The lie required none. In the attention economy, effort loses.

**The social cost:** I was asking people to go against consensus, to be the contrarian. That's psychologically expensive.

**The tribal signal:** For some, this had become identity, not policy. Challenging it felt like a personal attack.

**The exhaustion factor:** This was issue #47 people were supposed to research this week. They were tired.

There's a pattern here you might recognize. It's similar to what researchers at the RAND Corporation documented about the Putin/Trump communication strategy: the "firehose of falsehood."[^3] Vox's Carlos Maza did an excellent breakdown of this technique[^4] showing how it works in practice.

**The mechanism:**
1. Put out a lie
2. By the time experts formulate a response
3. And verify their facts
4. And publish their analysis
5. It's old news
6. The discourse has moved on to lies #2 and #3
7. By the time your correction publishes, they're on lie #5

**The goal isn't belief—it's exhaustion.** You don't need people to believe the lie. You just need them to be too tired to fight it.

By the time truth arrives, the battle is already over.

## Now You Can See the Pattern

Let me recap the five stages:

**Stage 1: Initial Nonsense** – No filter at point of origin. Incoherent claims enter the system unchallenged.

**Stage 2: Media Translation** – Nonsense becomes "news." Journalists extract "policy positions" from gibberish to maintain neutrality.

**Stage 3: Viral Spread** – Optimized for replication, not accuracy. Simple lies beat complex truth.

**Stage 4: Social Proof** – "Everyone knows this." Social consensus substitutes for verification.

**Stage 5: Failed Corrections** – Truth too slow, too complex, too late. The lie has already won.

**The uncomfortable truth:** This isn't unique to tariffs. This isn't unique to one politician. This is how the system works now.

Once you see it, you'll see it everywhere:

- "They're eating the dogs" (viral before verified, false but now in political discourse)
- "Crime is up" (feels true, contradicts FBI data, shapes policy anyway)
- "Windmills cause cancer" (absurd, but got news cycles)
- Any simple claim about complex systems

The pattern is identical. Different content, same cascade.

**You now have a framework.** When you see an incoherent claim that gets translated into policy talk, when you see something go viral before it's verified, when you notice "everyone's talking about it" substituting for "it's true," when you watch corrections arrive after discourse has moved on—you're watching the five-stage cascade in real-time.

This is why I couldn't stop the tariff lie alone. This is why smart, well-meaning people repeated economic nonsense. This is why fact-checking failed.

**Because it's not a people problem. It's a system problem.**

---

## What This Means

I understand economics. I do first-principles analysis. I can recognize fundamental truths that others miss. And I couldn't stop this.

Not because I'm not smart enough. Not because I didn't try hard enough. But because **one person can't fix a system problem.**

You can't fix what you can't see. Now you can see it.

That's step one.

But seeing the pattern raises the question: **Why does our system work this way? Why is there no immune response?**

Every other high-stakes system has filters, has quality control, has mechanisms to stop bad information at the source. Markets have price signals. Science has peer review. Engineering has safety standards. Medicine has clinical trials.

**Why doesn't our political system have an immune system for lies?**

That's the question for Part 2.

In the next piece, I'll show you why every attempted fix has failed—why better journalism doesn't solve it, why fact-checking doesn't work, why "media literacy" isn't enough. I'll show you what systems that work have that politics lacks, and why this is one of the hardest problems in modern governance.

Because here's what I've learned: The obvious solutions don't work. The problem is deeper than you think. And the stakes are higher than you imagine.

But you can't begin to fix something until you understand why it's broken.

You've seen what's broken. Next, we'll figure out why.
